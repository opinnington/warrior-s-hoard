# Warrior's Hoard
<strong>WIP</strong>. Warrior's Hoard is a fictional historic weaponry website. This website used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<br>This was done during the first year of college and I plan to implement more to this website including introducing PHP and WordPress to make it more functional.
